    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to Roast My Excuse. By downloading, installing, or using the app, you agree to these Terms of Service.</p>

    <h2>Use of the App</h2>
    <p>Roast My Excuse is a mobile game provided for entertainment purposes. You may use the app for personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to misuse the app or attempt to interfere with its normal operation, including but not limited to attempting to manipulate the AI scoring system.</p>

    <h2>Accounts</h2>
    <p>The app creates an anonymous account automatically. You may optionally link a Google account to preserve your progress. Your game progress is tied to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of any linked accounts.</p>

    <h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for the content you submit, including excuses, appeals, and display names. By submitting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display your content within the app (including the public feed and leaderboards). You agree not to submit content that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contains hate speech, slurs, or targeted harassment against real people or groups</li>
        <li>Contains sexually explicit or graphically violent material</li>
        <li>Infringes on the intellectual property rights of others</li>
        <li>Attempts to manipulate or exploit the AI scoring system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to remove content and restrict accounts that violate these guidelines. Content may be automatically flagged and hidden by our AI moderation system.</p>

    <h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Scores, feedback, and appeal rulings are generated by artificial intelligence. These are meant for entertainment purposes only and should not be taken as factual assessments. AI responses may occasionally be inaccurate, unexpected, or offensive. We do not guarantee the quality or appropriateness of AI-generated content.</p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>The app displays advertisements through Google AdMob. Some features (rematch, additional appeals, streak freeze) require watching a rewarded advertisement. Ad availability depends on third-party ad networks and is not guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>Leaderboards and Public Feed</h2>
    <p>The app features public leaderboards and a daily feed. Display names and excuses you submit will be visible to other players. You agree not to use offensive or inappropriate display names.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content in Roast My Excuse, including but not limited to graphics, text, game mechanics, and design, is owned by the developer and protected by applicable intellectual property laws.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The app is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the app. AI-generated content is for entertainment only.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to damages related to AI-generated content.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the app at any time for violations of these Terms, without prior notice.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
