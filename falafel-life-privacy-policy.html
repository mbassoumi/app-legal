    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>Falafel Life ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile game developed by an independent developer. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Anonymous Authentication</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Anonymous Authentication to create a unique anonymous identifier for your device. This does not collect your name, email, or any personal contact information.</p>

    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Analytics to understand how players interact with the game. This includes general usage data such as screens visited, features used, and session duration. This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

    <h3>Crash Reporting</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and error logs. This helps us identify and fix bugs. Crash data may include device type, operating system version, and the state of the app at the time of a crash. No personally identifiable information is included in crash reports.</p>

    <h3>Leaderboard Data</h3>
    <p>If you participate in the leaderboard, we store your chosen display name and game score. Display names are player-chosen and do not need to be your real name.</p>

    <h3>Advertising</h3>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve relevant ads. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

    <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
    <p>In-app purchases are processed through Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We use RevenueCat to manage purchase status. We do not collect or store payment information directly.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and improve the game experience</li>
        <li>To maintain leaderboards and game progress</li>
        <li>To identify and fix crashes and bugs</li>
        <li>To understand general usage patterns</li>
        <li>To display advertisements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. Data is shared only with the third-party services listed above (Firebase, Google AdMob, RevenueCat) solely for the purposes described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Game data is retained as long as you have the app installed. Anonymous authentication data and analytics are retained according to Firebase's default retention policies. You can reset your data by uninstalling and reinstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Falafel Life is a general audience game. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not require any personal information to play.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we only collect anonymous data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. Uninstalling the app will remove all local data from your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date above.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on our GitHub repository or contact us through the app store listing.</p>
